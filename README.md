# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK-
Task 1 submission for the Coding Samurai AI internship.

This machine learning project uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset containing 50k movie reviews to create a sentiment analysis and machine learning model. The dataset is highly balanced and consists of 25,000 highly polar positive and negative movie reviews. The various machine learning classifiers used in this video include Logistic Regression, Multinominal Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector Classifiers.


1. **Logistic Regression:**
   Logistic Regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome. In our context, it helps classify movie reviews into either positive or negative sentiment based on various features extracted from the text.

2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes:**
   Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification method that's particularly effective for text and document classification tasks. It's based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

3. **Linear Support Vector Classifiers:**
   Linear Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) are a type of supervised learning models used for classification tasks. SVC tries to find the best possible hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space, making it a powerful tool for sentiment analysis by defining a clear boundary between positive and negative sentiment in our movie reviews dataset.

These classifiers, each with its unique approach and strengths, are utilized to effectively analyze and classify the sentiment of movie reviews within the IMDB dataset.

This project leverages Google Colab notebooks, a cloud-based interactive computing environment, for developing and executing the neural network model. Google Colab provides a free, GPU-accelerated platform that facilitates collaborative coding, data analysis, and machine learning tasks. This allows for seamless implementation and experimentation with the neural network architecture to classify handwritten digits using PyTorch and CNN. The advantages of using Google Colab include access to powerful computing resources, a variety of pre-installed libraries, and the ability to easily share and collaborate on the project with team members.
